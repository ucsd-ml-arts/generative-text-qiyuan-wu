## Abstract
American Psycho, is a 2000 American neo-noir satirical psychological horror film co-written and directed by Mary Harron, based on Bret Easton Ellis's 1991 novel of the same name. The movie is set on 1988 and examines the shallowness and vanity along with extreme indifference towards the others induced by materialism, which makes the protaganist become a "psycho". I choose the script of this movie as the training set for this project not only because it is my favourite movie, but also because the protagonist Patrick Bateman is only "in touch of humanity" instead of an actual normal human that can feel the genuine emotions, which coincides with the nature of AI. For this project, I will try to use machine learning to generate a dialogue that resembles the idiosyncratic, eccentric and sacarstic style of the movie. RNN model will be used to achieve the goal, and parameters will be altered and tested to better the outcome. I'll also separate the script into 2 categories: Bateman's lines and other people's lines, so that Bateman's idiosyncrasy of language can be reserved.


## Model/Data

Briefly describe the files that are included with your repository:
- trained models
- training data (or link to training data). what is your corpus?

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- training_code.py or training_code.ipynb - your training code

## Results

- Documentation of your generative text in an effective form. A file with your generated text (.pdf, .doc, .txt). 

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)
